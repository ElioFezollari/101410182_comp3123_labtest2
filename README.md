The entire web app only has 1 screen, in the top left there is a Search City input with the city name, that dynamically changes the result based on what the user inputs, if
the city is not valid, it shows the appropriate error screen. Next there is the title of the city with the corresponding flag for the country (another api is used to grab the flag, flagsapi). Below this we have the weather icon and the weather status, and below that 4 modals showing main info, visibility, wind and clouds.After this section is the section which shows the weather for the future (3 hour incrementals since that is the only timespan the api allows me to use for free). More specifically it shows the next 7 weathers in the 3 hour time span
